# js-background-show

Started coding: dec, 2018.

3 weeks in my study for web developer. 

I've learned the basics about HTML and CSS, and started week 3 of with JavaScript. 

Really wanted to see the functionality of JavaScript after learning the past week, so decided to look for a video on Youtube for beginners with basic knowledge. 

So i made a basic landingpage with an background image slideshow controlled with JavaScript. 

Really happy with the result and almost as I wanted it to be :).

And overal a good learning excercise for beginners.
